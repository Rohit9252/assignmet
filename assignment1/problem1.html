    <!-- <b> tag brief  -->
    <h1> b tag</h1>
    <p>The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use b tag  for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the element to indicate that text is of special importance.</p>

        <p>
            The <i> HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the </i> naming of this element.

    <div>
        <h1> select tag </h1>
        <p>
            The <select> seleect</select> select tag is HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.
                
                    Each option element should have a value attribute containing the data value to submit to the server when that option is selected. If no value attribute is included, the value defaults to the text contained inside the element. You can include a selected attribute on an option tag element to make it selected by default when the page first loads.

                        The select tag element has some unique attributes you can use to control it, such as multiple to specify whether multiple options can be selected, and size to specify how many options should be shown at once. It also accepts most of the general form input attributes such as required, disabled, autofocus, etc.
